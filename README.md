#### Buttons get_field('');

Creating simple button with PHP and WP(link) with opening site on the new page and assigning specific URL.

#### Problems I ran Into & Solutions

I was dealing with problem uploading SVG files into the site. 
From the article provided from tutor and information given by WP site (Blocked due security reasons) I found out its not good to use SVG files because its taken as a document file and creates many vulnerabilities for attackers. (XSS attack)
But for this learning process I just simply installed pluggin called "Safe SVG".


### Useful resources
