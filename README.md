## Overview

### Tasks CMS

- Responsive PHP / HTML / CSS / JS one-page design implemented in WordPress
- You are allowed to use front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, Material Design
etc
- You are not allowed to use page builder plugins (Elementor, Beaver Builder, SeedProd, etc.)
for your theme. In other words, you must use your coding skills for this.
